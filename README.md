# SciKit-Learn
This repository contains graduate course work from Pennsylvania State University's DAAN862: Analytics Programming in Python on supervised and unsupervised learning with SciKit-Learn demonstrating advanced understanding and application of the SciKit-Learn package to:

* Perform train-test splitting
* Perform cross-validation methods
* Evaluate and build the following models
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Clustering
  - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Adaboos
